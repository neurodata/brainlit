    "Region growing methods iteratively examine pixels neighboring seed points, and determine if these neighboring pixels should be added to a region. Three such methods are available: \\ In closed-connected thresholding, pixels in a region are connected to a seed and lie within a range of values. Here, the lower threshold is automatically calculated based on the Gaussian Mixture model thresholding above. \\ In neighborhood-connected thrsholding, pixels in a region are connected to a seed and lie within a neighborhood. Again, the lower threshold is automatically calculated based on the Gaussian Mixture model thresholding above.\\ In confidence-connected thresholding, pixels in a region have intensities consistent with a seed point; the pixel intensities lie within a confidence interval such that they are within some \"multiplier\" number of standard deviations from the mean of the neighborhood of the seed point. In this example, the multiplier is set to 1. If multiple iterations are used, the mean and standard deviation are calculated again at each iteration using pixels in the previous segmentation.\n",
