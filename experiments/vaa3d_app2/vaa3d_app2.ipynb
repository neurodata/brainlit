    "# APP2 Testing on Mouselight Benchmarking Dataset\n",
    "Frederick Xu\n",
    "\n",
    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "For the Brainlit team's efforts in determining the best method to trace the mouselight imaging dataset, this Python notebook undertakes the testing and analysis of All-Paths-Pruning 2 (APP2), published by Xiao & Peng et. al. 2013. The algorithm is an improvement upon APP1, published by the same authors in 2011. APP2 makes key modifications to APP1, namely through the use Gray-Weighted Image Distance Transform (GWDT) instead of a Binary Thresholding, Fast-Marching Algorithm instead of Dijkstra's Algorithm for initial reconstruction, and Hierarchical Branch Pruning instead of Linear Branch Pruning for efficiency. GWDT will be used to identify the soma, or \"source\" of the reconstruction, as the cell body is expected to be a large region of high intensity and can be singled out by GWDT. However, this means that the algorithm is likely to work only in a single-source setting, leading to potential difficulties when attempting to trace multi-source images.\n",
    "\n",
    "As such, it is hypothesized that APP2 will perform poorly on the Mouselight Benchmarking Dataset. The dataset is a series of cropped tiff images of mouselight neuron data. For this particular experiment, the images labeled \"test\" will be used. These images are varied in their contents, with some containing multiple parallel axons while others depict more web-like structures. Very few of these images depict cell bodies, adding to the potential of APP2 to fail. The degree of noise in the images also varies, so we may observe APP2's performance under a variety of clean to noisy background conditions. To verify the correctness of the obtained traces, corresponding manual ground truth traces are included in the Mouselight Benchmarking Dataset. Significant Spatial Distance, or SSD, can be computed based on Peng et. al. 2010 and Xiao & Peng et. al. 2013 to gauge the disparity between the the APP2 Trace and the Manually Traced Ground Truth.\n",
    "\n",
    "The implementation of APP2 being used is included in the 3D Visualization-Assisted Analysis Software Suite (Vaa3D). This application is based in C++ and takes various imaging formats as inputs, one of which is tiff files. The software outputs .swc files that can be analyzed and plotted in napari as label points. To assist in batch testing, an open-source Python wrapper for Vaa3D will also be used."

    "Firstly, for the 3 of the 4 highest SSD-scoring images (16, 19, 12), there is a very notable issue of separated axons, where there may be multiple axons running through an image slice while being disconnected. APP2 does poorly as it makes an assumption about having a single-source, or soma, to originate from. As such, the algorithm is only successful in tracing one of these axons that run through the image slice, while the others go unnoticed. From the positions of the soma (yellow marker), we can see that only one point of origination is selected, and the algorithm traces until it is unable to branch out any further due to encountering background. This creates a very high SSD score, as the distances drawn from the APP2-trace to the ground-truth-trace span a large gap.\n",

    "For the final image, test_4-gfp, this is a case of a very noisy image being difficult for APP2 to handle. We can see that the algorithm is unsure of what is noise and what is neuron, and subsequently traces everything. The high SSD is a result of there being only 1 true axon that runs through the imageslice, again resulting in very long distance draws between the APP2-trace and ground-truth-trace."

    "Of the previous images, test_4-gfp was the most extreme example of APP2's sensitivity to noise in the testing images. Similar examples of this sensitivity vary in SSD scores. test_1-gfp and test_25-gfp showed similar results of noise sensitivity, despite being in the lower range of SSD scores at ~20. test_2-gfp and test_23-gfp have moderately high SSD scores of 72.1 and 59.4 respectively, but also display similar tendencies to trace noise. It appears that SSD does not necessarily provide information of whether or not a trace is satisfactory, as it depends on the ground truth trace complexity. We can observe that test_1-gfp and test_25-gfp have more complex ground truth traces, spanning a larger area than those of test_2-gfp and test_23-gfp. This results in a lower SSD score, as each point in an APP2-trace of 1 and 25 is relatively closer to a ground truth compared to that of 2 and 23."

    "Lastly, APP2 performed qualitatively well in 2 of the tested images. APP2 on test_21-gfp managed to trace most of the ground truth, however it deviated and began tracing background, despite the regions of low intensity. The best-performing image was test_15-gfp, where APP2 managed to capture most of the ground truth trace, with the exception of a few smaller trace segments that run along the side of the image. It is very apparent that the neurons spanning these two images can be described by a single source, as such APP2 is relatively successful in tracing these images. With regards to SSD scores, test-21_gfp had a low SSD score of 15.1, while test-15_gfp had an SSD score of 19.9. Despite test-15_gfp being a more successful trace, its SSD score is higher than that of test-21_gfp. It appears that SSD is a relatively inaccurate metric to use to decide trace quality."

We can see that, although the neuron has been successfully traced, there is still large detection of noise, creating erroneous labels on the fringes of the neuron. Overall, this performance is not adequate as it once again shows the algorithm's sensitivity to noise in these images."

    "# Conclusions\n",

    "Based on the implementation characteristics of APP2, it was hypothesized that the algorithm would perform poorly for images that could contain \"multiple sources\", as the algorithm relies on a single-source assumption. The results depicted here demonstrate the algorithm's inability to trace across large gaps in the image, where multiple axons may be running through an image slice in a disconnected fashion. Additionally, the algorithm's sensitivity to noise was unknown. A quite common outcome observed was the algorithm bleeding outwards into noisy portions of the background, creating numerous erroneous traces. As such, this algorithm is poorly fit for the tracing task that we wish to undertake. If we were to further test this algorithm, we may wish to consider modifications that could potentially allow for multi-source traces, or manually specify a soma on a larger imageslice that contains a whole neuron. It must also be said that these testing images very rarely mimic a potential situation with a whole neuron present, so perhaps testing on images more suited for the algorithm's implementation assumptions will yield better results."
